# 🏆 My Competitive Programming Journey
### Hey there, fellow coder! 👋 

Welcome to my personal repository where I’m documenting every problem I solve across various competitive programming platforms. This is where I track my learning, share my solutions, and note down key insights. 🚀

## 📚 Platforms I’ve Been Exploring:
- **Codeforces**
- **LeetCode**
- **AtCoder**
- **And maybe more in the future... 🌱**

## 📁 What’s Inside?
#### Each folder contains:
- **My Solution:** The code I wrote to solve the problem.
- **README File:** A short explanation of the problem, my approach, challenges faced, mistakes made, and what I learned along the way. (Consider it a mini journal entry! 😄)

## 💡 Why Am I Doing This?
### For myself:
- **Track my progress:** Keeping a record helps me reflect on how far I’ve come.
- **Organize my learning:** I can easily revisit problems and solutions for reference.
- **Improve:** Every time I look back, I learn something new, be it about a better solution or a concept I missed.

### And maybe for YOU:
- f you’re a fellow competitive programmer or someone interested in problem-solving, I hope you find this repo helpful. 🤞
- Feel free to look around, suggest improvements, or ask questions. Let’s learn together!

## 📝 What’s Next?
- I plan to keep updating this repo as I solve more problems and dive deeper into new concepts.
- Any tips, suggestions, or constructive feedback are always welcome! 💬
